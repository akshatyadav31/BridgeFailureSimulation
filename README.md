# Bridge Failure Probability Simulation

This Python application simulates the probability of failure in bridges using Monte Carlo simulation.

## Features

- Specify bridge parameters such as length, width, and material strength.
- Run Monte Carlo simulation with specified parameters.
- Visualize simulation results, including probability of failure and distribution of failure loads.
- Includes calculators for mean value and standard deviation of input data.

## Usage

1. Run the application.
2. Enter bridge parameters and click "Run Simulation".
3. View simulation results and histograms.
